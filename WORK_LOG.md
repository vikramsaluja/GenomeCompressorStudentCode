| Nov 17  | 9:15-9:55 | During this time I completed the compress and expand functions. For the compession I knew that I had wanted to represent the same data in a few number of bits, so to do so I am representing each charecter with a number instead. This takes up less memory, thus makes my compress functions effective. I also completed the expand function and did the same thing in reverse. I am comparing the key which is assigned to character to then return the fully expanded sequence. |

This is nessacry since it was something that my code previously did not have. I have also tried to make my code more abstract by using helper methods to do the actual comparisons rather than doing the whole thing in the compress and expand functions. |
